            <h3>MDN: Validating Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I forgot the syntax, but "this field is required" example would need "required" in the HTML, the HTML for the
                    phone number one would include "phone" somewhere, the email one would include "email",
                    and the 8-to-30-character-long one would contain some form of regular expression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Out of curiosity, could SQL injection be a way for malicious users to misuse unprotected forms?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ah, now I remember. The syntax for the phone and email validation use [type]. [min] and [max]
                    would also work for the character count portion of the 8-36 character form, and [pattern] is for the
                    regular expression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You could probably make a custom message for each submission error in JavaScript. Not sure why you would as
                    from what I know that kind of thing happens in the browser already, but if you want a custom thing, there you go.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hmm. I recognize fruit-start.html. Either it's some sort of default thing for teaching or I've read this before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There's a [:required] CSS pseudo-class? That would've been really useful last semester. I made a big red asterisk
                    with its own class and everything when I could've used the form itself. Or maybe I just wanted to make a big red
                    asterisk anyway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Now</i> I remember this page. I had to read the regular expressions section and I had no idea what on earth
                    I was doing. This is the thing I compared to the regular expression section in Novice to Ninja some weeks back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Why is the default error message's dependence on browser locale considered a problem? From what I can tell, the
                    person chose that language from the browser, so misunderstanding isn't an issue. Does it have to do with consistency?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>MDN: Using Fetch</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I didn't know [response.ok] was a shortcut. Neat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Even the article's examples don't know what else to do when fetch support isn't detected.
                    The comment's in the form of a question and everything.
                </li>
            </ul>
