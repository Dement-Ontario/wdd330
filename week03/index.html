            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Object Methods: This</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I'd imagine [this] is useful when you have a list of objects that each contain the same method.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The fact that [this] isn't bound to anything and relies on context seems to support this idea.
                </li>
                <li>
                    [this] also seems to enforce the idea of a function only doing one thing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    So if I'm getting this right, non-arrow functions called inside of methods don't
                    attribute [this] to the object?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Making your key with a space in it seems like a bad idea if you want to constantly reference it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wonder if the long way of making objects is more confusing to read than the short way.
                    It would probably depend on what you're used to.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Y2K was an actual thing that happened? Huh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Again, a paid subscription has explained regular expressions better than anything else that I've read so far.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ohhh, the W3C in W3C Validator stands for World Wide Web Consortium. It makes sense now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I can see why I was taught [querySelector] first. You can get very specific with that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    So that's why [firstChild] wasn't working in my CSS, it was probably getting the text node
                    instead of the element.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was wondering where [innerHTML] was in the text creation methods list. I forgot it was more than that.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Events</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I wonder if the [target] property could shorten part of my Javascript final's event listeners from
                    using a nested function into just a callback. I was having trouble with including parameters in the
                    event listeners' callbacks back then since those needed the parentheses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Double-clicking clicks twice, so the click event will happen twice per one double-click event.
                    I wonder if that's useful anywhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I know all too well about tapping something when I want to scroll.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
