            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Transforms and Transitions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I think I remember transitions being used at one point in WDD 230. I think the
                    activity that had them had to do with lazy loading, and we had to use transitions
                    to gradually unblur an image from a placeholder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If I remember right, we used shorthand for the transitions. That explains why I
                    couldn't remember the properties.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The animation plugin for the game-maker I make models in has keyframes as well,
                    so I think I might understand this a bit more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Are there typically strings and such in CSS? I don't remember there being any from what I know.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wonder why an undeclared animation-duration is 0s by default. That seems counterproductive.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It's the Python Pillow greenscreen activity all over again, except it's making the image grayscale
                    and there's only one image. I thought I could escape it, but it found me after all this time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Arguably</i> easier? Drawing a circle in SVG certainly seems easier to me than whatever that arc stuff was.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Those are the first <i>few</i> lines?! No wonder there are tools for SVG.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "openclipart.org". I'll have to remember that.
                </li>
            </ul>
