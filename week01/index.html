                    I never thought about putting the nav bar on the bottom of the screen.
                    Considering how a lot of people hold their phones,
                    it makes a lot of sense to do that.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Honestly, what I read and watched were pretty straightforward.
                    Not really any questions about the material this week, I think.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If I haven't done anything else, I hope the dynamic table of contents
                    in the home page works well enough for this week.
