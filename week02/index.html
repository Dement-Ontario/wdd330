            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Programming Basics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I probably wouldn't understand what my code from two semesters ago was supposed to do if
                    I looked at it now since I rarely put in comments, if ever.
                    I still don't; I should add more comments while doing exercises this semester.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I guess reserved words are part of the reason we name variables the way we do.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I didn't know you could declare multiple variables at the same time.
                    Probably makes things harder to read, though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assigning one single object to two different variables might not be in anyone's
                    best interests. Not sure, though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Finally, an understandable explanation of what the % operator actually does.
                    All I needed to find that out was a paid subscription.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Wait, you can have undefined items between defined items in an array?
                    I mean, it makes sense since you should be consistent, but I didn't think you could do that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is there a way to remove elements from an array entirely?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Oh, right, there's pop() and shift().
                </li>
                <li>
                    And splice(). Didn't know about splice().
                </li>
                <li>
                    I can see why my JS class didn't talk about sets and maps (or at least I don't remember them doing so).
                    They're a bit out of the way, and arrays seem simpler to use in general,
                    especially if you've worked with Python's sets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Man, for loops over arrays are complicated in JS. Now I know why my JS class taught map() and forEach() first.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wait, nevermind, why didn't they teach about the for-of loop? That looks like Python for loop levels of simple.
                    Still gonna keep using forEach, though.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I might know why I got what I wanted from my code by simply removing parentheses from the function call now.
                    Maybe not the details, but at least that it did something way different by just referencing it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thinking about it, they were probably callbacks at those times.
                </li>
            </ul>
