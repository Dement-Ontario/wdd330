            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Forms</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    So avoid any property mix-ups by either making your form name unique or using square brackets. Got it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Oh, I get it. It's called a [blur] event because it's not focused anymore.
                    I don't know if that's intended to be funny, but it got a chuckle out of me.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Adding error messages to every label from JS seems like a good way to declutter your HTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Last I checked, you could use regular expressions as a method of form validation, no?
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    So you can use a constructor function to create multiple of the same object whenever you need to
                    and use arguments to assign different attributes to them. My memory is a bit spotty on Python classes,
                    but this definitely seems similar.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ah, there we go. There's the kind of class I remember, constructor and all.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was wondering where [init] would come in, since it wasn't the constructor. Turns out it's an object method.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Modern Javascript: Modular Javascript</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Yet again, the paid subscription explains modules far better than anything else I've read.
                    I'm starting to notice a pattern.
                </li>
            </ul>
