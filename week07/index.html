            <h3>Further Functions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Maybe you could add a failsafe with [null] in a function for if there isn't anything for [this].
                </li>
                <li>
                    I was wondering what you use in JS to wait a few seconds. I think it was something like [sleep] in Python.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I think I remember there being a thing I had to do with [promise] and [then] in an earlier JS class.
                    To be honest, I had no idea what it did. Now I kind of get it, and it is thus another "paid subscription,
                    better explanation" type deal. Man.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ajax</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Ajaj doesn't really roll off the tongue like Ajax, so I can see why it didn't take off.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hope [redirect()] is supported sometime. That looks useful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I remember having to use [json()] with [fetch()] in my old JS class. We had to get a list of temples
                    from a URL and print some to the document. I had no idea what I was doing, but somehow it worked out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I do like a good Chuck Norris joke, but now I'm curious as to when this book was made.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I just realized that the temples thing I mentioned earlier might be the thing I did with [promise]
                    that I wrote about in the last chapter's notes. It's been about a year, so it's a bit blurry, but
                    it might've been [fetch] instead of [promise]. It definitely had [then], though.
                </li>
            </ul>
