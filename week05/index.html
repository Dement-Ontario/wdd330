            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    From what I can tell, feature detection could also be good at showing the viewer API-specific content,
                    like a game-hosting website only showing VR players games with VR support (if a VR API exists, of course).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The [debugger] command looks useful if you want to put in breakpoints ahead of time. Looking back, that might've
                    helped with the W02 Team Activity, since some of the testing I did with the inputs caused the window to freeze.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I remember [try] being part of Python programming. Can't remember what else was there, though.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Back in one of my Python classes, we had to use a program called Pytest to test our code. Now I wonder if Pytest
                    is a testing framework, since it seems to fit the description in the book.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Judging by how Jest looks from the book and its similarities to what I remember from Pytest,
                    I'm leaning toward "yes" for it being a testing framework.
                </li>
            </ul>
