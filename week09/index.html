        </header>
        <main>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <h3>The Window Object</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A more dubious practice than making popup windows to annoy people would be
                    making popup windows to scare people.
                </li>
                <li>
                    So from what I can gather, changing [window.location.href] is like
                    clicking a link or changing the URL on that little bar at the top of the browser.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wonder if [setTimeout] or [setInterval] could be used like actual timers.
                    I would guess there's something better for that, though.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I think I remember using [data-] on a [src] element when I learned about
                    different-sized images for different-sized resolutions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ah, so my camelCaseJs/hyphenated-html stylings go along with datasets' stylings. Nice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ayyy, [localStorage]. Get/set and all that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I wonder if [getCurrentPosition()] can be used for that fancy weather API I
                    had to use in WDD 230. That had longitude and latitude.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You could probably use the audio and video controls to do something like pause the audio/video
                    when it's offscreen or annoy people by periodically setting the volume at random intervals.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
